# Monte Carlo
A straightforward Monte Carlo simulation for stock price prediction. The historical prices from the last year (of the given stock) are used to run simulations to predict the prices over the next year. Python 3.6 was used to develop this.

## Steps 
- Run `python monte-carlo.py`
- Enter stock ticker
- Enter number of simulations

## Output
- First chart shows the historical prices of the last year for a given stock
- Second chart shows the results of the Monte Carlo simulations
- Third chart shows the average of all the Monte Carlo simulations
- The final prediction of the price of the given stock a year from now is printed to the console
